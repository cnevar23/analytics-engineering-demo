#dbt Fundamentals

This repository is part of my initial exploration of dbt. I'm using it to learn the core concepts and get hands-on practice with building models in BigQuery. As I work through the fundamentals, I'll be experimenting with sources, staging models, tests, and documentation to better understand how dbt fits into the modern data stack.
